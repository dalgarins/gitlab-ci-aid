## Why Gitlab CI Aid?

<!-- Plugin description -->
Do you frequently work with Gitlab CI Yaml files in Intellij and find yourself constantly using `Shift Shift` to search 
for stages, script files or included files? Gitlab CI Aid to the rescue. With this plugin, enjoy automatic Gitlab schema 
provision, navigation across elements, stage/job autocompletion, and prominent error notifications when issues are detected 
in configuration. Reduce errors and accelerate your pipeline development.

## Features

* Autocomplete & Syntax Highlighting: Write Gitlab CI YAML files with confidence. Autocompletion suggestions and multi 
  level syntax highlighting will make your code easy to navigate and work with.
* Local Path Resolution: Effortless navigation with one-click access to scripts, included files, job needs and more.
* Errors and Quick fix: IDE integrated warning/error for undefined stages, jobs, scripts and quick fix to create scripts on the fly
* Script Language Injection: Injection of shell language in script blocks for .sh autocompletes, suggestions and shortcuts
* Schema Support: Auto detection of Gitlab CI YAML and auto schema configuration, with descriptions, errors and suggestions for Gitlab known keywords 

## Getting Started

* **Installation**: Download the plugin from JetBrains Marketplace
* **Usage**: Enjoy autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and much more with Gitlab CI YAML files.

* Only works with local files currently, no components, remote files or templates

## Known Issues

## Notes
* Some features may not work while IntelliJ is indexing the project
* If there's an issue with some feature, reopening the file should help
