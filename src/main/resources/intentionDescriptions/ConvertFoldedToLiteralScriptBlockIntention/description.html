Converts multi line folded script block (>) to literal script block (|) in GitLab CI/CD YAML files.
This is useful when you want to preserve line breaks in the script block, as folded blocks will replace newlines with
spaces resulting in non-working experience with "Edit shell script fragment" action.
For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/">GitLab CI/CD documentation</a>.
